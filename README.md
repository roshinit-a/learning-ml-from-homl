## 📘 Why This Project?

In a world increasingly powered by AI, I wanted to **build a solid foundation** in machine learning — not just by watching tutorials or reading blog posts, but by **getting hands-on** with the concepts that power real-world ML systems.

By systematically going through this book, I aim to:

- 🔬 Understand the *theory* behind core ML algorithms
- 🛠️ Apply them using Python and powerful libraries like Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
- 📈 Build an intuition for data, models, and evaluation
- 🧠 Develop clean, readable, and professional code
