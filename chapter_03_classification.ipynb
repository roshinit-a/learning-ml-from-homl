You look at that single image, calculate the error for *it*, and take a small step downhill. Then you pick another random instance, and so on.\n",

Because it only looks at one instance at a time, you can train it on *massive* datasets (billions of instances!) that would never fit in your computer's RAM.

    "\n",
    "2. `dummy_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_5)`: When you call `fit`, it **completely ignores** `X_train`. It doesn't look at the images at all. It only looks at the labels (`y_train_5`). It counts them to find out which class is the most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say in your `y_train_5` data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 90% of the labels are `False` (not a 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10% of the labels are `True` (is a 5)\n",

    "This classifier is used to check our sanity and establish a **baseline score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we \"train\" it, if you ask it to predict the accuracy on the test set, it will predict `False` for *every single image*. Since 90% of the images are *not* 5s, it will get an accuracy of about 90% just by being dumb!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that any \"real\" model (like your `SGDClassifier`) **must** get an accuracy *higher* than 90% to prove that it's actually learning something useful. If your fancy model only gets 91% accuracy, you know it's barely better than a model that just guesses \"not-5\" every time.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This is our \"control panel.\" The X-axis is the threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you move the threshold (dotted line) to the right (get stricter):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The **Recall** curve (green) *always* goes down.\n",
    "    - The **Precision** curve (blue) *generally* goes up \n",
    "    - **Why Recall is Smooth (The Easy One)**\n",
    "        - **Recall's Formula:** ​$Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$\n",
    "        - **Let's simplify that:** The denominator ($TP + FN$) is just the *total number of actual 5s* in the dataset. This number is **fixed**. It never, ever changes, no matter what our threshold is. Let's say there are 5,421 real 5s.\n",
    "        - **The Action:** As we **increase the threshold**, we get stricter. We start to miss some of the real 5s. This means our number of True Positives ($TP$) can only **go down or stay the same**. It can *never* go back up.\n",
    "        - **The Result:** Since the top number ($TP$) can only go down and the bottom number (Total 5s) is fixed, the final score can *only* go down. This creates a smooth, downward-sloping line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Why Precision is Bumpy (The Tricky One)**\n",
    "        - **Precision's Formula:** $Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$\n",
    "        - **The Problem:** The denominator ($TP + FP$) is the *total number of items our model predicted as a 5*. This number is **not fixed**. It changes every time we move the threshold.\n",
    "        - **The Action:** As we **increase the threshold**, we are trying to get rid of False Positives ($FP$). But as we do, we might also get rid of True Positives ($TP$).\n",

    "- Let's use the book's exact example: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1. Starting Point (Central Threshold):**\n",
    "        - The model predicts 5 items are \"5s\".\n",
    "        - The truth is: 4 are True Positives (real 5s) and 1 is a False Positive (a '6').\n",
    "        - Precision = $TP/(TP+FP)=4/(4+1)=80%$.\n",
    "    - **2. Move Threshold 1 Step Right (past a real '5'):**\n",
    "        - We just moved our line past a **True Positive**.\n",
    "        - The model now predicts only 4 items are \"5s\".\n",
    "        - The truth is: 3 are True Positives and 1 is *still* a False Positive (that '6').\n",
    "        - Precision = $TP/(TP+FP)=3/(3+1)=75%$.\n",
    "        - **Look! Our precision just went *down*!** This is the \"dip\" in the bump.\n",
    "    - **3. Move Threshold 1 More Step Right (past the '6'):**\n",
    "        - We just moved our line past that annoying **False Positive** (the '6').\n",
    "        - The model now predicts only 3 items are \"5s\".\n",
    "        - The truth is: All 3 are True Positives. The False Positive is gone.\n",
    "        - Precision = $TP/(TP+FP)=3/(3+0)=100%$.\n",
    "        - **And our precision just *shot up*!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** Precision is \"bumpy\" because as we raise the threshold, we may lose a True Positive *before* we lose a False Positive. This causes a temporary *dip* in our score before it (in general) goes back up. Recall's denominator is fixed, so it can't have this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **Plot 2: Precision vs. Recall**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to select a good precision/recall trade-off is to plot precision directly against recall..\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use this plot to say, \"I want recall to be about 50%, so I'll pick a threshold of 3,000.\""

    "## **The ROC Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright! Let's get through this final, important section on binary classifiers. We've learned about Precision, Recall, and the PR curve. Now we're going to learn about the *other* major tool: the **ROC Curve**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is the ROC Curve?**\n",
    "The **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** is another graph we use to see how good our classifier is. It's very similar to the PR curve, but it plots two different things:\n",
    "- **Y-axis (Vertical): True Positive Rate (TPR)**\n",
    "  - This is just a fancy name for **Recall**. we already know this!\n",
    "  - It's the ratio of actual 5s that our model correctly identified. (Formula: $TP / (TP + FN)$)\n",
    "- **X-axis (Horizontal): False Positive Rate (FPR)**\n",
    "  - This is the new one. It's the \"false alarm\" rate.\n",
    "  - It's the ratio of **non-5s** that our model *incorrectly* labeled as a 5. (Formula: $FP / (FP + TN)$)\n",
    "  - $FPR=1−Specificity$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the ROC curve plots **Recall** (Sensitivity) vs. **1- Specificity** (Fall-Out).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How to Read the ROC Curve**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the data for this, we use `roc_curve()`, which works just like `precision_recall_curve()`:"

    "\n",
    "Now, we have two types of algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithms that are \"natively\" multiclass:** They can handle 10 classes right out of the box. Examples are `RandomForestClassifier` or `LogisticRegression`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strictly binary classifiers:** Algorithms like `SGDClassifier` and `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier) only understand \"A vs. B.\" They just can't handle \"A vs. B vs. C vs. D...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do we do? Do we just throw away our binary classifiers? No! We get creative and use a few smart strategies to make them work for multiclass problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main strategies are **One-versus-the-Rest** and **One-versus-One**."

    "\n",
    "    - ...and so on, up to the **\"9-detector\"** (9 vs. not-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to Predict:** When we get a new image (let's say it's our \"5\"), we feed it to **all 10** of our classifiers. Each one will output a \"decision score.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The \"0-detector\" will say, \"I'm 90% sure this is *not* a 0.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The \"1-detector\" will say, \"I'm 85% sure this is *not* a 1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The \"5-detector\" will say, \"I'm 98% sure this *is* a 5!\"\n",

    "- **Our MNIST Example:**\n",

    "- **How to Predict:** When we get a new image, we have to run it through **all 45 classifiers.** Each classifier \"votes\" for one of the two classes it knows. The class that **wins the most \"duels\"** is our final prediction.\n",

    "So, why would we ever want to train 45 classifiers (OvO) when we could just train 10 (OvR)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The OvO Advantage:** The main advantage of OvO is that each of its 45 classifiers only needs to be trained on a *tiny* part of the dataset. The \"0 vs. 1\" classifier, for example, only ever sees the images of 0s and 1s.\n",
